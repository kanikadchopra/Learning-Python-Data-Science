# Learning-Python-Data-Science
This is filled with examples I have completed from the Python Data Science Handbook, as well as my own examples to test out the tools I was learning. For many of the concepts I have learned, I have also attached links to the GitHub projects I completed to test out my knowledge with real-life examples. 

## Topics Covered:
1. Numpy
  * Basics of Numpy
    * Creating arrays, Attributes, Indexing, Slicing, Reshaping, Joining and Splitting Arrays 
  * Computations and Aggregations
    * uFuncs: arithmetic, absolute value, trigonometric functions, exponents and logarithms, specialized ufuncs (from scipy import special)
    * Advanced uFunc Features: specifying output, aggregates and outer products
    * Aggregate Functions: summarizing values, min, max, multi-dimensional aggregates
       * [Basic Data Analysis Project: US President Heights](https://github.com/kanikadchopra/President-Height-Data-Analysis)
    * Broadcasting on Arrays: rules of broadcasting, centering an array, plotting a two-dimensional function
  * Comparisons, Masks and Boolean Logic
  * Fancy Indexing
  * Sorting Arrays 
  * Structured Data: NumPy's Structured Arrays

# Plan To Complete by May 2019:
2. pandas
  * Data Indexing & Selection
  * Operating on Data in pandas
  * Missing Data
    * Find a data set and complete an example with this 
  * Hierarchical Indexing
  * Combining Datasets
    *Concat and Append
    *Merge and Join
  * Pivot Tables
    * Another example with data set
  * Vectorized String Operations
  * Time Series
    * Example to demonstrate skils
  * High-Performance pandas: eval() and query()
    

3. matplotlib
a) Line Plots
b) Scatter Plots
c) Visualizing Errors
d) Density and Contour Plots
e) Histograms, Binnings and Density
f) Customization
i. Plot Legends

h) In Depth: Principal Component Analysis
i) In Depth: Manifold Learning
j) In Depth: k-Means Clustering
k) In Depth: Gaussian Mixture Models
l) In Depth: Kernel Density Estimation
m) Application: A Face Detection Pipeline

* Do a machine learning project on Kaggle once this is completed

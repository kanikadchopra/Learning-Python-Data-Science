# Learning-Python-Data-Science
This is filled with examples I have completed from the Python Data Science Handbook, as well as my own examples to test out the tools I was learning. This shows the concepts that I have self-taught myself to continue building my data science knowledge. For many of the concepts I have learned, I have also attached links to the GitHub projects I completed to test out my knowledge with real-life examples. 

## Topics Covered:
1. Numpy
  * Basics of Numpy
    * Creating arrays, Attributes, Indexing, Slicing, Reshaping, Joining and Splitting Arrays 
  * Computations and Aggregations
    * uFuncs: arithmetic, absolute value, trigonometric functions, exponents and logarithms, specialized ufuncs (from scipy import special)
    * Advanced uFunc Features: specifying output, aggregates and outer products
    * Aggregate Functions: summarizing values, min, max, multi-dimensional aggregates
       * [Basic Data Analysis Project: US President Heights](https://github.com/kanikadchopra/President-Height-Data-Analysis)
    * Broadcasting on Arrays: rules of broadcasting, centering an array, plotting a two-dimensional function
  * Comparisons, Masks and Boolean Logic
  * Fancy Indexing
  * Sorting Arrays 
  * Structured Data: NumPy's Structured Arrays

# Plan To Complete by May 2019:
2. pandas

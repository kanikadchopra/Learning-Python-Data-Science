# Learning-Python-Data-Science
This is filled with examples I have completed from the Python Data Science Handbook, as well as my own examples to test out the tools I was learning. For many of the concepts I have learned, I have also attached links to the GitHub projects I completed to test out my knowledge with real-life examples. 

# Topics Covered:
1. NumPy
a) Basics of NumPy: Creating arrays, attributes, indexing, slicing, reshaping, joining and splitting arrays
b) Computations and Aggregations on NumPy Arrays: 
i. uFuncs - arithmetic, absolute value, trigonometric functions, exponents and logarithms, specialized ufuncs (from scipy import special)
ii. Advanced uFunc features - specifying output, aggregates, outer products
iii. Aggregate Functions - summarizing values in an array, min, max, multi dimensional aggregates
- Project: https://github.com/kanikadchopra/President-Height-Data-Analysis
iv: Broadcasting on Arrays - 
c) Comparisons, Masks and Boolean Logic
d) Fancy Indexing
e) Sorting Arrays
f) Structured Data: NumPy's Structured Arrays 

# Plan To Complete by May 2019:
2. pandas
a) Data indexing and selection
b) Operating on Data in pandas
c) Missing Data 
* Find a data set and complete an example with this 
d) Hierarchical Indexing 
e) Combining Datasets
i. Concat and Append
ii. Merge and Join
f) Pivot Tables
* Another example with data set 
h) Vectorized String Operatons 
i) Time Series
* Another example to demonstrate skills
j) Hihg-Performance pandas: eval() and query()

3. matplotlib
a) Line Plots
b) Scatter Plots
c) Visualizing Errors
d) Density and Contour Plots
e) Histograms, Binnings and Density
f) Customization
i. Plot Legends
ii. Colorbars
iii. Ticks
iv. Configuration and Stylesheets
g) Multiple Subplots
h) Text and Annotation
i) Three-Dimensional Plotting
j) Geographic Data with Basemap
k) Seaborn Visualization

* For each of these types of graphs, find a dataset to try visualizing them and create links to the projects here

# Plan to Finish by July 2019
4. Machine Learning
a) Scikit-Learn
b) Hyperparameters and Model Validation
c) Feature Engineering
d) In Depth: Naive Bayes Classification
e) In Depth: Linear Regression
f) In Depth: Support Vector Machines
g) In Depth: Decision Trees and Random Forests
h) In Depth: Principal Component Analysis
i) In Depth: Manifold Learning
j) In Depth: k-Means Clustering
k) In Depth: Gaussian Mixture Models
l) In Depth: Kernel Density Estimation
m) Application: A Face Detection Pipeline

* Do a machine learning project on Kaggle once this is completed
